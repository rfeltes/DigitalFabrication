            Hi everyone! I'm Rachel, a first year HCDE master's student with a background in mobile development. Until this year I was working in the healthcare tech industry. I love to try out new methods of creation – my most recent undertaking is learning how to handsew clothing. So far I have sewn a poorly fitting bucket hat and a pair of renaissance booty shorts.
            </p>
            <p>
            I'm excited for this class because of the opportunity to learn how to make things in a new way. I'm looking forward to learning about 3D printing and am happy to have been given an excuse to buy my own printer. I'd love to try to lend a hand if anyone is looking for help on web dev, adobe illustrator, or inkscape.
            </p>
